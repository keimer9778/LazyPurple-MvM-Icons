# Documentation for LazyPurple's MvM Server

You can expect to find regular updates here pertaining to custom icons whenever new maps and missions are added to the servers.

To get the icons to load in-game, download the .vtf and .vmt for that icon and place them in tf/materials/hud.
Then type hud_reloadscheme in console.
